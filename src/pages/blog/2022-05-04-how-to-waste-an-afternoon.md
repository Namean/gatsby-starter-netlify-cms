**C**ontrary to the title I've not been wasting my time, but building an application 5 years in the making. Exciting right? Well may so maybe not depending on your skill level. However to me building this application has been quite complicated. However I'm convinced that by building the application it will help me build applications easier in the future.

I've had to make an expedition all over the inter-webs excavating old relics of code of mine. That I've carefully put in to place to make a dust but well oiled machine! The application goes beyond just a simple page or banger one liner.

### Functionality:

There are two pieces to this application currently, three when I feel like I hate myself enough to add a database ðŸ˜€. Anyway as of now I'm saving the data to a *.json file(s). I was just going to split the files by day, then reach back when I wanted to query the data. However I'd have to write custom functions to handle these operations. Which may cause me to learn how to use a database engine. Which I'm leaning towards Postgres.

### Security:

Did I mention that I don't have any? My data is just exposed to the world in the words of `Pantera` "**naked** and **bared**". So I'm got to figure out how to configure an SSL certificate. I'm using HTTPS:// with a self-signed certificate. So I'm not just tottally twisting in the wind.
