Anyway I was listening to some old dude on Youtube about how to get a \`real\` developer job. He said I should build a game. But Really I should build a bug/issue tracker, more on that later. 

While I skulking around Udaciy, yeah bet you remeber it just like your mom's birthday. Anyway I came across some tutorials on something called LibGDX. Which said that I can build games cross platform. Which everything is cross platform these days. So I decided to look into it myself without the course.

### LibGDX

<li>https://libgdx.com/dev/</li>
<li>https://libgdx.com/wiki/start/setup</li>
<li>https://libgdx.com/wiki/start/project-generation</li>
</ol>

You'll also want to download this baby:

https://libgdx-nightlies.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/libgdx-runnables/gdx-setup.jar

With the machine that I'm on I'll need a JDK, Android SDK, and Gradle. All of which can be provided through Android Studio.zip mind you. Because I'm locked out of conventional methods of installation do to UAC.

### LibGDX Project Setup

You've been lolled into this project with its nice feature set and display of example projects and you think that following the instructions is going to build with out any errors. You fool, you couldn't be more wrong!

Turns out
